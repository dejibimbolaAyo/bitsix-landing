# Designing for Accessibility: A Comprehensive Guide

Accessibility in web design isn't just about complianceâ€”it's about creating experiences that work for everyone. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the key principles and practical techniques for building accessible digital products.

## Understanding Web Accessibility

Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. This includes:

- Visual impairments
- Hearing impairments
- Motor impairments
- Cognitive impairments

  disabilities will leave a website if it's not accessible - Accessible websites
  have 50% more potential reach
