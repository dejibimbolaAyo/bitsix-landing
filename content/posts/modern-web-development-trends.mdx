# Modern Web Development: Trends and Technologies to Watch in 2024

The web development landscape is constantly evolving, with new technologies and approaches emerging regularly. Let's explore the key trends and technologies that are shaping the future of web development in 2024.

## Key Trends in 2024

### 1. Performance-First Development

- Core Web Vitals optimization
- Server-side rendering resurgence
- Edge computing adoption
- Image optimization techniques

<InfoBox title="Performance Impact">
  - 53% of mobile users abandon sites that take over 3 seconds to load - A
  1-second delay in page response can result in a 7% reduction in conversions -
  Core Web Vitals are now a Google ranking factor
</InfoBox>

### 2. Modern JavaScript Frameworks

- React Server Components
- Vue 3 Composition API
- SvelteKit adoption
- Astro's growing popularity

<CodeBlock language="javascript">
// Example of React Server Component
async function BlogPost({ id }) {
  const post = await fetchPost(id);
  
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </article>
  );
}
</CodeBlock>

### 3. Web Components and Micro-Frontends

- Custom elements
- Shadow DOM
- Module Federation
- Micro-frontend architecture
